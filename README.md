# swag.lgbt

this is my website. it's written with [qwik](https://qwik.builder.io) and deployed to [cloudflare](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

The interesting bits are probably the [flags](src/components/flag/flags), which i took from [Josh W Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/pride-flags/), and the [font](https://github.com/phoikoi/VT323), which is thanks to [Peter Hull](https://github.com/phoikoi) with further contributions by [Jacques Le Bailly](https://github.com/Fonthausen), [Dave Crossland](https://github.com/davelab6), [Lasse Fister](https://github.com/graphicore), and [Marc Foley](https://github.com/m4rc1e).
